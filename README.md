A simple game where the goal is to remember the cards and not pick the same card twice.

## Description

There are 12 cards of Japanese cuisine, ranging from sweet to savory. You're goal is to click each card only once to win. If you get one wrong, you'll have to start over.

This project was built using React. I built this to practice React concepts such as components and hooks such as State.
